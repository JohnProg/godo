Godo - Todo list API Server
====

A to-do list API server written in Go similar to many others out there. 

What separates this from many other task managers: 

* Tasks are assigned to a day.
* Tasks not completed can be copied to the next day.

Future Plans:

* Tasks can be part of features
* Time tracking
* Sync with Pivotal Tracker
